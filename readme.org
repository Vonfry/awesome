#+title: Awesome

An extensive list of interesting open source projects, articles and other things
for *myself*. Most of things are collected because of I used.

All files are written in ~org-mode~ with ~CUSTOM_ID~, so all the
internal link cannot be used outside.

Applications are placed in application categories instead of system.
In other words, applications for different OS are listed togather.
Some of them are cross platfroms, but some of them are not so.

Some tools/services for both development or not are placed in application,
and some are mainly for development are placed in development.
Simple system resource are placed in application, but complex operation and
maintenance tools are under development.
