#+TITLE: Shells
#+AUTHOR: Vonfry

This mainly means linux/unix shell. Winodows powershell is good, but hardly
using for daily and we have other better language for scripts, if you don't use
~.net~.

* Terminal
- xterm
- urxvt
- termonad :: Terminal emulator configurable in Haskell.
- alacritty :: use gpu for terminal

* Shell
  - sh :: Please write script use this.
  - bash :: The default one, it is inconvenient to use.
  - zsh :: Quickly, easy, having a lot of plugins and more interactive.
      - Framework
          - antigen :: plugin manager, it can manage compiling and plugins
            automatically. Fast!
          - zplug :: plugin manager
          - prezto :: simple and fast.
          - oh-my-zsh :: Powerful! But slowly! NOT RECOMMENDED.
            Oh-my-zsh is good, having a lot of functions but I don't need them. The
            most important reason is speed and stdandard, for example, oh-my-zsh
            uses ~source~ to load theme, prezto uses ~zstyle~.
      - prompt
          - [[https://github.com/starship/starship][starship]] :: The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt
            for any shell!
          - powerlevel10k
      - Plugins
          - autosuggestions :: fish like
          - syntax-highlighting :: fish like
          - you-should-use :: ZSH plugin that reminds you to use existing aliases
            for commands you just typed.
  - fish :: Like zsh, but it contains a lot of functions which are implemented by plugis. It also has a more morden shell script, but /not posix/, so conflicting with some tools.
  - tcsh
  - powershell :: Support by windows. Combine with ~.NET~. It has a superior script language, but using for interactive is bad. And why not using ruby, perl, python or other scripting language? More about see: [[../sys-os/windows.org][sys-os/windows.org]]
  - [[http://xon.sh/][xonsh]] :: python based

* Utils
  List some useful tools.

  - tree :: show dir structure as a tree
  - colordiff
  - fortune-mod :: print a saying
  - cmatrix :: show coding matrix in terminal
  - figlet :: ascii art
  - gpatch :: Apply a diff file to an original
  - parallel :: like xargs, but use more cpus

** Useless

Impress people with your insane multitasking skills. Just open a few instances of genact and watch the show. genact has multiple scenes that pretend to be doing something exciting or useful when in reality nothing is happening at all.
   - autojump :: quickly jump to dirs.
