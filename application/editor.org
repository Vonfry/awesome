* Navigation & Completion & Syntax Check
  each editor has its own way to do this, but here is a surprising thing which
  is [[file:../development/util.org::#lsp][lsp]] designed by microsoft!

* Coding Style
  A precondition: using differnt sytle for different language.

  [[http://editorconfig.org/][Editorconfig]] is a tool to let all stuffs using the same coding style in a
  project.

* Vim
  vim is one of the best editor on the world. It provied a good editing method by
  normal, insert, visual and other modes.

* Emacs
  Emacs is one of the best editor on the world. Its default editing mode is used
  in many morden editors such as all text input form on macos.

  But I don't like emacs default editing method. I use evil insteaded.

  The most powerful thing is ~emacs-lisp~. You can de anything here! So, why not
  use it with vim.

  And emacs author seems hardworking more than vim.
** Configure
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: configure-id
   :END:

   Here are some samples, but I suggest only take a look as a reference. Write config by yourself!
