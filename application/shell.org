#+TITLE: Shell
#+AUTHOR: Vonfry

This mainly means linux/unix shell. Winodows powershell is good, but hardly
using for daily and we have other better language for scripts, if you don't use
~.net~.

* Shell
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       6be16198-8f29-4071-9c76-b71dc8adf87b
  :END:
  - sh :: Please write script use this.
  - bash :: The default one, it is inconvenient to use.
  - zsh :: Quickly, easy, having a lot of plugins and more interactive.
      - Framework ::
          + antigen :: plugin manager, it can manage compiling and plugins
            automatically. Fast!
          + zplug :: plugin manager
          + prezto :: simple and fast.
          + oh-my-zsh :: Powerful! But slowly! NOT RECOMMENDED.
            Oh-my-zsh is good, having a lot of functions but I don't need them. The
            most important reason is speed and stdandard, for example, oh-my-zsh
            uses ~source~ to load theme, prezto uses ~zstyle~.
      - prompt ::
          + [[https://github.com/starship/starship][starship]] :: The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt
            for any shell!
          + powerlevel10k
          + pure ::
      - Plugins ::
          + fzf-tab ::
          + fzf-marks ::
          + zsh-navigation-tools ::
          + zsh-autocomplete ::
          + zsh-completions ::
          + zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting ::
          + zsh-history-substring-search ::
          + autosuggestions :: fish like
          + you-should-use :: ZSH plugin that reminds you to use existing aliases
            for commands you just typed.
  - fish :: Like zsh, but it contains a lot of functions which are implemented by plugis. It also has a more morden shell script, but /not posix/, so conflicting with some tools.
  - tcsh ::
  - powershell :: Support by windows. Combine with ~.NET~. It has a superior script language, but using for interactive is bad. And why not using ruby, perl, python or other scripting language? More about see: [[../sys-os/windows.org][sys-os/windows.org]]
  - [[http://xon.sh/][xonsh]] :: python based
