   - [[https://www.criu.org/Main_Page][CRIU]] :: Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace, or CRIU (pronounced kree-oo, IPA:
     /krɪʊ/, Russian: криу), is a Linux software. It can freeze a running
     container (or an individual application) and checkpoint its state to
     disk. The data saved can be used to restore the application and run it
     exactly as it was during the time of the freeze. Using this functionality,
     application or container live migration, snapshots, remote debugging, and
     many other things are now possible.
