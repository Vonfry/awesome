Here is some generic build tools for large project, cross languages or
scripting.

Each language has its own toolsets, please check their own collections.

* Universal
  - make ::
  - automake ::
  - [[https://shakebuild.com/][shakebuild]] :: Large build systems written using Shake tend to be
    significantly simpler, while also running faster. If your project can use a
    canned build system (e.g. Visual Studio, cabal) do that; if your project is
    very simple use a Makefile; otherwise use Shake.

* Package/Environment
  - [[file:../system/nixos.org::#nix][nix]] ::

* Mobile
