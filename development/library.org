Different from language libraries, here lists some generic frameworks, that are
exposed to many languages by ffi.

Or they are focused on CS fields instead of language itself, such as most of AI
projects are in python but they are topic on AI instead of python.

* Compression
  - [[https://github.com/facebook/zstd][zstd]] :: Zstandard - Fast real-time compression algorithm

* Graphics
** Library
   - [[https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose][openpose]] :: OpenPose: Real-time multi-person keypoint detection library for
     body, face, hands, and foot estimation
** Project
   - [[https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x][waifu2x]] :: Image Super-Resolution for Anime-style art using Deep
     Convolutional Neural Networks. And it supports photo.
** Tutor

* Artificial Intelligence
** Machine Learning
*** LLM
**** Some Productions
     - [[https://github.com/serge-chat/serge][serge]] :: a chat interface crafted with llama.cpp for running Alpaca
       models. No API keys, entirely self-hosted!
     - [[https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals][petals]] :: ðŸŒ¸ Run LLMs at home, BitTorrent-style. Fine-tuning and inference
       up to 10x faster than offloading
     - [[https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui][text generation webui]] :: A Gradio web UI for Large Language
       Models. Supports transformers, GPTQ, llama.cpp (GGUF), Llama models.
**** Dev Framework
     - langchain :: chain prompt, llm, and other actions togather such as agent
     - griptape :: like langchain, but different architecture
     - langserve ::
     - [[https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow][langflow]] :: Langflow is a UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to
       provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows.
     - [[https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat#serving-with-web-gui][fastchat]] :: An open platform for training, serving, and evaluating large
       language models. Release repo for Vicuna and Chatbot Arena. Webui,
       controller, model (worker) API architecture.
     - [[https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT][autogpt]] :: an experimental open-source application showcasing the
       capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. It is used for agent
       development.
     - [[A high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs][vllm]] :: A high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving
       engine for LLMs. It supports OpenAI api and self designed api for models.
     - [[https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT][MetaGPT]] :: The Multi-Agent Framework: Given one line Requirement, return
       PRD, Design, Tasks, Repo
     - [[https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot][gpt-polit]] :: Dev tool that writes scalable apps from scratch while the
       developer oversees the implementation.
**** train/model/datasets
     - [[https://github.com/PolisAI/awesome-llm-human-preference-datasets][awesome llm human perference datasets]] :: a collection of human preference
       datasets for LLM instruction tuning, RLHF and evaluation.
     - [[https://huggingface.co/][huggingface]] :: The AI community building the future.
     - [[https://hf-mirror.com/][hf-mirror]] :: huggingface mirror
     - [[https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI][colossal ai]] :: Making large AI models cheaper, faster and more accessible
     - LLaMA :: A foundational, 65-billion-parameter large language model. Made
       by Meta.Inc.
