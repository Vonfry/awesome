* Release
  - Gentoo :: A flexible, source-based Linux distribution that becomes just
    about any system you need—and much more. You can choose what you want to
    install with a package.
      - Anything(installation, development environment, overlay or others) about
        it can be fountd on its [[http://wiki.gentoo.org/][*wiki*]].
  - [[file:nixos.org][NixOS]] :: NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
    configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager, it is
    completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many
    other advantages.
  - Kali :: Kali Linux Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation
  - qubes os :: A reasonably secure operating system

  Both NixOS and Gentoo are my love. And the archlinux's wiki is the best wiki I
  think. Other distributions are used for special usage in virtual machine.
